- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (enforced by Black)
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Docstring Format (Google Style)
```python
def predict_student_performance(data: pd.DataFrame) -> np.ndarray:
    """Predict student performance based on input features.

    Args:
        data: DataFrame containing student features with columns:
            - 'age': Student age
            - 'grades': Previous grades
            - 'attendance': Attendance percentage

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: Array of predicted performance scores

    Raises:
        ValueError: If required columns are missing from input data
    """
```

### Import Organization
```python
# Standard library imports
import os
import sys
from typing import Dict, List

# Third-party imports
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Local imports
from src.data_loader import load_student_data
from src.preprocessing import clean_data
```

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_model.py -v

# Run tests with specific marker
