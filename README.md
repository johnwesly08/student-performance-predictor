# 🎓 Student Marks Prediction Model

A machine learning project to predict students' academic performance based on various features such as study time, attendance, previous scores, etc.

---

## 📌 Features

- Clean, modular ML pipeline
- Data preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction script
- Easy-to-read codebase with logging
- Ready for deployment or further experimentation

## 🧠 Model Overview

The model uses `Linear Regression` (or your chosen model) to predict student marks.

**Steps:**
1. Data Loading
2. Cleaning & Preprocessing
3. Model Training
4. Evaluation & Prediction
